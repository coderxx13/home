                  requirements, aims, and financial situations.
                  <br /><br />
                  4. Potential Disturbance in Service
                  <br /><br />
                  You shall be responsible for keeping and sustaining all
                  telephone, computer hardware, software, and other tools

                  screening programs, indistinct codes, or loopholes within
                  specific documents or other content.
                  <br /><br />
                  5. Overload of system volumes
                  <br /><br />
                  Damage due to severe weather, tremors, battles, insurgency,
                  riots, terrorism, civil disorder, the act of God, accident,
                  fire, water damage, blast, mechanical collapse or natural
                  tragedies.
                  <br /><br />
                  Disruption (whether limited or total) of electricity or other

                  court or tribunal commands or other human intrusions.
                  <br /><br />
                  Any other reason (whether like or unlike to any of the
                  previous) whatsoever beyond our control.
                  <br /><br />
                  If access to this Website is not available, deferred or
                  restricted, or if this Website does not work rapidly and
                  proficiently, you may be not able to transfer your
                  instructions for transactions and other matters, or such
                  instructions may not be performed on time or you may be not
                  able to recover information on a timely basis. If your
                  processes are reliant on such communications with us, and such
                  communications are disturbed or deferred, you may face losses.
                  Open Meta will not be responsible for any such loss.
                  <br /><br />
                  6. Links to other sites
                  <br /><br />
                  Links to unaffiliated websites are given only as indicators to
                  information on areas that may be beneficial to users of this
                  Website, and we have no control over the data on such
                  unaffiliated websites. If you like to connect to a website we
                  do not control, we claim no guarantees, either direct or
                  indirect, regarding your use of or incapability to use such
                  site, the material of such site, including the precision,
                  completeness, consistency, or appropriateness thereof for any
                  specific aim, nor do we guarantee that such site or material
                  is free from any privileges of copyright, trademark, or other
                  violation of the rights of third-parties or that such site or
                  material is free of bugs or other virus. We do not assure the
                  legitimacy of documents on the Internet. Links to unaffiliated
                  sites do not indicate any authorization of or obligation for
                  the views, ideas, products, information, or services
                  accessible at such sites, or any depiction about the data at
                  such sites and we explicitly renounce any such authorization
                  or depiction. Moreover, these third-party websites may have a
                  privacy policy or security procedures dissimilar from this
                  Website, so it is significant to go through the policies of
                  those sites before sharing your personal information.
                  <br /><br />
                  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                  <br /><br />
                  As a result of high Internet traffic, transmission problems,
                  systems capacity limitations, and other problems, you may, at
                  times, experience difficulty accessing the Web site or
                  communicating with Open Meta through the Internet or other
                  electronic and wireless services. Any computer system or other
                  electronic device, whether, it is yours, an Internet service
                  provider's or Open Meta can experience unanticipated outages
                  or slowdowns, or have capacity limitations.
                  <br /><br />
                  8. Content not to be construed as a solicitation or
                  recommendation:
